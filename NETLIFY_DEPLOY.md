# NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT - ALTERNATIVE TO VERCEL

Since Vercel is being stubborn, let's use Netlify:

## Option 1: Drag & Drop (EASIEST)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the `dist/spa` folder to the deploy area
3. BOOM - INSTANT DEPLOYMENT!

## Option 2: GitHub Integration

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. "New site from Git"
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build:client`
   - Publish directory: `dist/spa`
   - Node version: 18

## Option 3: Netlify CLI

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/spa
```

BUILD IS READY ✅
NETLIFY CONFIG READY ✅
NO FUNCTION RUNTIME ISSUES POSSIBLE ✅
