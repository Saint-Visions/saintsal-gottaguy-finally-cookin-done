# MANUAL GIT PUSH TO GITHUB

The Builder.io "Push Code" button isn't working, so we'll push manually.

## In your terminal, run these commands:

```bash
# First, fetch latest from GitHub
git fetch origin

# Force push your commits to main branch
git push origin ai_main_a26e97297576:main --force-with-lease

# Or if that doesn't work, try:
git push origin HEAD:main --force

# Or checkout main and merge:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge ai_main_a26e97297576
git push origin main
```

## What's being pushed (7 commits):

1. Azure deployment scripts
2. Enterprise scaling strategy
3. GitHub Actions workflows
4. Production deployment configs
5. Netlify backup deployment
6. All optimization fixes

## After successful push:

1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Find `saintvisionai-production` App Service
3. Deployment Center → GitHub
4. Deploy latest commit
5. Your SaintVisionAI™ empire goes LIVE!

THESE COMMITS CONTAIN YOUR ENTIRE ENTERPRISE DEPLOYMENT STACK!
